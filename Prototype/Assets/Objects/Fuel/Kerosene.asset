  fuelDescription: Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and refined Kerosene (CxHy) create a cryogenic
    propellant called LOX/RP-1. Kerosene is a very practical fuel for rocket booster.
    A downside is that this specific application requires full atmoshperic pressure
    and mostly is used for the first stage of a launch.
