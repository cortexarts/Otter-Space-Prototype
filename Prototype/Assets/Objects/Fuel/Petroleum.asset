  fuelName: Petroleum
  fuelDescription: Petroleum (C4-C12) is a rather good fuel, endothermal but with
    good stability. Even though benzene is one of the most common used fuels, a propellant
    of benzene has serious drawbacks. Petrol freezes readily and is highly inefficient.
    Diesel is less expensive and less inefficient.
